Create a single script to pull tweets from @SnailMonitor, parse them to compute GPU
restocking frequency on Amazon.

Outline:
    Collect tweets
    For each tweet, get ASIN, then add to running statistics
    Output statistics to Google sheets
    Retrieve multiple pages of tweets
    Store and retrieve stats to look backward more than one week
    Get product name
    Average time between restocks, time since last drop
    First drop, last drop
    Time since last drop
    Restocking over days of week for single ASIN, to try to find patterns in restocking
--> Output data over multiple time scales: last week, last month, last three months, all-time
    Deployment

Refactoring:
    Done:
        Use Timelines from Twitter API to get more tweet history
        Save last update time in database

    To Do:
        Get rid of temp CSV file and just write to/from Pandas dataframe
        Add other products (3060, 3090, anything else notified?)
        Allow for duplicate hashtags in tweets (3060 vs. 3060TI)
        Expand column size to fit entries
        Normalize time output format

Additions:
    Get product MSRP (CamelCamelCamel?)
    Histogram for restock time of day
    Correlation between restock of different products?
