Create a single script to pull tweets from @SnailMonitor, parse them to compute GPU
restocking frequency on Amazon.

Outline:
    Collect tweets
    For each tweet, get ASIN, then add to running statistics
    Output statistics to Google sheets
--> Store and retrieve stats to look backward more than one week
    Get product name with ASIN
    Visualization of restocking for single ASIN, to try to find patterns in restocking
    Get product MSRP and put into spreadsheet

Refactoring:
    Get rid of temp CSV file and just write into Pandas dataframe
