Create a single script to pull tweets from @SnailMonitor, parse them to compute GPU
restocking frequency on Amazon.

Outline:
    Collect tweets
    For each tweet, get ASIN, then add to running statistics
    Output statistics to Google sheets
    Retrieve multiple pages of tweets
    Store and retrieve stats to look backward more than one week
--> Get product name
    Get product MSRP
    Visualization of restocking for single ASIN, to try to find patterns in restocking
    Deployment

Refactoring:
    Use Timelines from Twitter API to get more tweet history
    Get rid of temp CSV file and just write to/from Pandas dataframe
    Allow for duplicate hashtags in tweets (3060 vs. 3060TI)

Additions:
    Disregard duplicate tweets
