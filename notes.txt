Create a single script to pull tweets from @SnailMonitor, parse them to compute GPU
restocking frequency on Amazon.

Outline:
    Collect tweets
    For each tweet, get ASIN, then add to running statistics
    Output statistics to Google sheets
    Retrieve multiple pages of tweets
    Store and retrieve stats to look backward more than one week
    Get product name
--> Restocking over days of week for single ASIN, to try to find patterns in restocking
    Summary of stats for each product
    Deployment

Refactoring:
    Done:
        Use Timelines from Twitter API to get more tweet history

    To Do:
        Get rid of temp CSV file and just write to/from Pandas dataframe
        Allow for duplicate hashtags in tweets (3060 vs. 3060TI)
        Expand column size to fit entries

Additions:
    Get product MSRP
